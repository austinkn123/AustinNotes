Deployment environments




The typical order of environments in the software development lifecycle, from development to production, is as follows:

1. **Development Environment (Dev)**:
   - This is where developers write, modify, and test the code.
   - It's often an individual developer's local machine or a shared development server.
   - Development environments are not standardized and may vary between developers.
2. **Quality Assurance Environment (QA)**:
   - Once the code is developed and tested locally, it moves to a QA environment for more rigorous testing.
   - QA environments are designed to systematically test the application for bugs, inconsistencies, and quality issues.
   - Automated testing tools are often used in this environment.
3. **Staging Environment**:
   - After passing QA, the application moves to the staging environment.
   - The staging environment closely mirrors the production environment to identify any issues that might arise in the real-world deployment.
   - Performance, security, and integration tests are performed here.
4. **User Acceptance Testing Environment (UAT)**:
   - Following successful testing in the staging environment, the software moves to the UAT environment.
   - UAT involves testing by end-users or business stakeholders to ensure that the software meets their requirements and expectations.
   - It's the final step before the software is considered ready for production.
5. **Production Environment**:
   - After successful testing in all previous environments, the application is deployed to the production environment.
   - The production environment is the live system where end-users access and use the software.
   - It requires careful monitoring and maintenance to ensure continuous reliability and performance.

### CI/CD Consideration:

In modern software development, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices are often implemented, altering the traditional order:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, and automated builds and tests are run. This can happen multiple times a day in the development environment.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: After passing automated tests in the CI pipeline, the application can be automatically deployed to higher environments, such as QA, Staging, and UAT, and eventually to production.

With CI/CD, the movement of code through different environments can be more automated, allowing for faster and more efficient development and deployment processes. The exact setup and order can vary between organizations based on their specific development and deployment strategies.
