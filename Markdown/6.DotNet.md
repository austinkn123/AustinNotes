### Assemblies: 

(Look at deployment notes)

##### Definition 

provide a standardized and encapsulated way to package, deploy, and manage code

- Fundamental units of deployment, version control, reuse, activation scoping, and security permissions for .NET-based applications
- Collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality
- provide the common language runtime with the info it needs to be aware of type implementations.

##### Implementation:

- Assemblies take the form of executable (*.exe*) or dynamic link library (*.dll*) files, and are the building blocks of .NET applications
- In .NET and .NET Framework, you can build an assembly from one or more source code files. In .NET Framework, assemblies can contain one or more modules. This way, larger projects can be planned so that several developers can work on separate source code files or modules, which are combined to create a single assembly

##### Ex:

**Step 1: Create a Class Library**

Create a new Class Library project named `MyLibrary`:

```c#
// MyLibrary/MyClass.cs
public class MyClass
{
    public void SayHello()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from MyLibrary!");
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Create a Console Application**

Create a new Console Application project named `MyConsoleApp`:

```c#
// MyConsoleApp/Program.cs
using MyLibrary; // Reference the MyLibrary assembly

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
        myObject.SayHello();
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Build and Run**

Build both projects. After building, you will find two output folders: one for the console application (`MyConsoleApp\bin\Debug` or `\Release`) and another for the class library (`MyLibrary\bin\Debug` or `\Release`).

When you run the console application, it will load and execute the code from the class library assembly (`MyLibrary.dll`).

This example demonstrates the concept of assemblies in .NET. The `MyLibrary.dll` is the assembly containing the `MyClass` type, and it is referenced by the console application (`MyConsoleApp.exe`). Assemblies provide a way to package and distribute code, and they play a crucial role in the modularity and versioning of .NET applications.



### Reflection:

##### Definition:

- enable you to obtain information about loaded [assemblies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/) (mentioned above) and the types defined within them, such as [classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/common-type-system#classes), [interfaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/common-type-system#interfaces), and value types (that is, [structures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/common-type-system#structures) and [enumerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/common-type-system#enumerations))
- Reflection provides objects that encapsulate assemblies, modules, and types. You can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object. You can then invoke the type's methods or access its fields and properties
