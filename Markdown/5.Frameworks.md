# What it is:

Code used to be repeated a lot to set up the basics and foundations of a program. Now programmers bundled that code together and called it a framework

- provide organization (modularity) and order
- EX: given folders and files already set up for you (like MVC separations principles)

# Asp.net [Core]

## Services:

Dependency Injection Service Lifetimes

Lifetimes (of the application):

- Singleton = creates a new instance for the lifetime of the application and continues to use it
- Transient = Create / use a new instance of object (data) for every request
- Scoped = Depends on the http request and creates an instance of that object for that request and continues to use that request

**Registering Services:**

- **AddSingleton**:
  - Registers a service as a singleton, meaning only one instance is created.
  - The same instance is returned every time the service is requested.
  - Use for services that maintain state or have high creation costs.
- **AddScoped**:
  - Registers a service as scoped, meaning one instance is created per scope.
  - Scopes are typically tied to the request lifetime in web applications.
  - Use for services that have a shorter lifetime or require different instances per scope.
- **AddTransient**:
  - Registers a service as transient, meaning a new instance is created every time it's requested.
  - Use for services that have no state or can be safely recreated.

## Dependency Injection

- Definition = design pattern that manages and resolve dependencies between classes and components throughout your application
  - creates instances of services that can be used throughout your app
  - Dependencies can include services, repositories, data access classes, logging utilities, or any other external component or resource.
  
- DUMB DEFINITION: Any service that your app needs is the dependency and you inject it by adding it to your container in Program.cs and the app has all these services to use after booting up

dependency injection is services in [builder.services](http://builder.services) in program.cs

- now you can add in constructor in controller

way of composing application

**Key Concepts:**

- **Services**:
  - A service is a component that provides functionality to other components.
  - Examples: Logging service, database service, authentication service, etc.
  - Services can be concrete classes or interfaces.
- **Containers**:
  - A container is responsible for managing the creation and lifetime of services.
  - In .NET Core, the built-in container is called the "ServiceProvider".
  - Containers resolve service instances when requested by components.
- **Controllers**:
  - Controllers receive services through constructor parameters.
  - This allows controllers to use the services without having a direct reference to them.
  - Example: A controller might receive a logging service through its constructor, allowing it to log messages without knowing the specifics of the logging implementation.

### benefits

- saves typing
- splits app into chunks
- services won't be tightly coupled
- **Loose Coupling**:
  - Components are decoupled, meaning they don't have direct references to each other.
  - This makes it easier to change or replace components without affecting the entire system.
  - Loose coupling promotes modular and scalable design.
- **Testability**:
  - Components can be easily tested in isolation using mock services.
  - Mock services mimic the behavior of real services, allowing you to test components without dependencies.
  - This makes unit testing more efficient and effective.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Services can be easily swapped or updated without affecting components that use them.
  - This allows for changes to the system without breaking existing functionality.

containers have different services have different types

- transicent, singleton, scoped

app has a container and whenever it needs di it reaches into container and grabs it

## Dependency Injection In a App

design pattern that lets you create instances of db, objâ€™s, etc, once and use it throughout several pages in the frontend instead of creating instances every time for every page

Dependencies folder

- All of the dependencies / libraries / packages needed for the application

Properties folder

- Has the launchSettings.json file which has the details of how the project should be started
  - Config details such as db connections and app settings are kept in this json file

Controller Folder

- Has all of the controllers of how we write all of our api methods / endpoints

Program.cs is the main entry point in the app

Dapper = Nuget Library that is a micro orm that can be added to a .Net project for database operations

- Micro ORM = object relational mapping (a way to retrieve data from queries and map those queries onto objects)
- Easier way to work with databases instead of creating, modifying, tracking databases
- reduces database access code

Async = async operations means when methods can be executed asynchronously

- allows it to perform long running or potentially blocking operations without blocking the main execution thread
- so it can start an operation or method and return control to the main execution thread

## Connection to Database using insight.database:

- add the connection string to appsetting.json
- create service configurations
- configure dependency injection in program.cs
  - register services to a di container, registering db connection
- create adaptors that uses database connection
- inject those adapters into use cases so use cases can use those adapters
- create endpoints so they can call the use cases to execute an action

bootup = setting container with services

assembly = app project

nested array = getting one inner array
