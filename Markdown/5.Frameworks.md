# What it is:

Code used to be repeated a lot to set up the basics and foundations of a program. Now programmers bundled that code together and called it a framework

- provide organization (modularity) and order
- EX: given folders and files already set up for you (like MVC separations principles)

# Asp.net [Core]

## Services:

Dependency Injection Service Lifetimes

Lifetimes (of the application):

- Singleton = creates a new instance for the lifetime of the application and continues to use it
- Transient = Create / use a new instance of object (data) for every request
- Scoped = Depends on the http request and creates an instance of that object for that request and continues to use that request

## Dependency Injection

- Definition = design pattern that manages and resolve dependencies between classes and components throughout your application
  - Dependencies can include services, repositories, data access classes, logging utilities, or any other external component or resource.

dependency injection is services in [builder.services](http://builder.services) in program.cs

- now you can add in constructor in controller

way of composing application

### benefits

- saves typing
- splits app into chunks

containers have different services have different types

- transicent, singleton, scoped

app has a container and whenever it needs di it reaches into container and grabs it

# Dependency Injection

design pattern that lets you create instances of db, objâ€™s, etc, once and use it throughout several pages in the frontend instead of creating instances every time for every page

Dependencies folder

- All of the dependencies / libraries / packages needed for the application

Properties folder

- Has the launchSettings.json file which has the details of how the project should be started
  - Config details such as db connections and app settings are kept in this json file

Controller Folder

- Has all of the controllers of how we write all of our api methods / endpoints

Program.cs is the main entry point in the app

Dapper = Nuget Library that is a micro orm that can be added to a .Net project for database operations

- Micro ORM = object relational mapping (a way to retrieve data from queries and map those queries onto objects)
- Easier way to work with databases instead of creating, modifying, tracking databases
- reduces database access code

Async = async operations means when methods can be executed asynchronously

- allows it to perform long running or potentially blocking operations without blocking the main execution thread
- so it can start an operation or method and return control to the main execution thread

## Connection to Database using insight.database:

- add the connection string to appsetting.json
- create service configurations
- configure dependency injection in program.cs
  - register services to a di container, registering db connection
- create adaptors that uses database connection
- inject those adapters into use cases so use cases can use those adapters
- create endpoints so they can call the use cases to execute an action

bootup = setting container with services

assembly = app project

nested array = getting one inner array
