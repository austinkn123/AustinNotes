## General:

### High avaliablity:

- No hardware
- Add more servers with a click (can replace instantly)
- Use clusters to ensure high avaliability

### Reliability:

- Resilience = ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- Deploy to many locations
  - global scale computing
  - protects against regional failures / disasters
- No single point of failure
  - resources in many locations
  - if one computer goes down, others can pick up the load

### Predictability

- knowing your app will always perform as expected and know the cost

### Security

- have full control of cloud security

### Governance

- standardizing cloud deployments to meet standards

### Manageability

- management of cloud resources and how we interact with them

**vm in cloud is expensive**

azure / aws

- provides SASS
- manages db for you
- manages vm’s and cloud stuff

moving to cloud

- moving code to cloud
- enabling SASS and code to work with cloud services





## Storage:



## Azure:

#### Storage

Storage Account → Container → Blobs

#### Blobs

- “Binary Large Object” = any data (anything made of bits / bytes)
- Can store
  - different image formats
  - all types of files
  - Streaming
  - any log file sizes
  - data stores (like archives)
- Blob Types
  - Block = stores text and binary data
  - Append = for append operations (ex: like logging)
  - Page = stores files

## AWS:
