## General:

### High avaliablity:

- No hardware
- Add more servers with a click (can replace instantly)
- Use clusters to ensure high avaliability

### Reliability:

- Resilience = ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- Deploy to many locations
  - global scale computing
  - protects against regional failures / disasters
- No single point of failure
  - resources in many locations
  - if one computer goes down, others can pick up the load

### Predictability

- knowing your app will always perform as expected and know the cost

### Security

- have full control of cloud security

### Governance

- standardizing cloud deployments to meet standards

### Manageability

- management of cloud resources and how we interact with them

**vm in cloud is expensive**

azure / aws

- provides SASS
- manages db for you
- manages vm’s and cloud stuff

moving to cloud

- moving code to cloud
- enabling SASS and code to work with cloud services





# Storage:

## Azure:

#### Storage

Storage Account → Container → Blobs

#### Blobs

- “Binary Large Object” = any data (anything made of bits / bytes)
- Can store
  - different image formats
  - all types of files
  - Streaming
  - any log file sizes
  - data stores (like archives)
- Blob Types
  - Block = stores text and binary data
  - Append = for append operations (ex: like logging)
  - Page = stores files

## AWS Cognito:

note for me:
You’ve decided to skip the configuration of this identity provider. You can configure it under "Sign-in experience" tab in the created user pool. Your app client won’t support this identity provider until it’s set up.



AWS Cognito is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of adding user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile applications. It offers features for authentication, authorization, and user management, making it easier to handle secure access and authentication without building everything from scratch.



Here's how AWS Cognito works:

### 1. **User Pools (Authentication)**

- **User Registration & Login**: AWS Cognito User Pools manage user registration and login for your app. Users can sign up, verify their email or phone number, and log in using a username, password, or third-party providers like Google, Facebook, or Amazon.
- **Authentication Tokens**: When users log in, Cognito User Pools generate JWT tokens (ID, access, and refresh tokens) that can be used for authentication. These tokens are sent with every request to secure your API.
- **Security Features**: Cognito supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), password policies, and account recovery (via email or SMS). It also integrates with AWS Lambda for custom authentication flows or additional processing during the authentication steps.

### 2. **Identity Pools (Authorization)**

- **Federated Identities**: AWS Cognito Identity Pools allow users to obtain temporary AWS credentials, enabling them to access other AWS services (like S3 or DynamoDB) securely. These credentials can be granted based on the user’s identity (logged-in user or guest).
- **User Identity from Various Sources**: You can manage users from different identity providers (like social sign-ins, OpenID Connect, SAML-based providers, or the Cognito User Pool itself) and assign them IAM roles to access AWS services.

### 3. **Federated Authentication**

- Cognito supports federated identities, which means you can authenticate users not only through Cognito itself but also through third-party identity providers like Google, Facebook, Apple, or SAML-based providers. This makes it easy to offer multiple sign-in options in your app.

### 4. **User Management**

- **User Profiles**: Cognito stores and manages user profiles, including attributes like email, phone number, name, and custom attributes you define.
- **User Groups & Roles**: You can organize users into groups and assign permissions or roles to these groups, making it easier to manage user access based on their roles in the application.
- **Triggers & Hooks**: You can use AWS Lambda to trigger custom logic (like validating or transforming data) at various points in the user authentication and registration flow (e.g., pre-sign-up, post-confirmation, etc.).

### 5. **Token-Based Authentication**

- Cognito issues tokens (ID, access, and refresh tokens) after successful authentication. These tokens are used to authenticate API calls and authorize access to various resources. The tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and contain user data, such as the user's identity, roles, and permissions.

### 6. **Integration with Other AWS Services**

- Cognito easily integrates with other AWS services like API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, which makes it a common choice for serverless architectures. By integrating Cognito with API Gateway, you can securely control access to your backend APIs.
- Cognito also integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for managing access to AWS resources, allowing you to define fine-grained permissions.

### Common Use Cases:

- **Authentication**: Adding user registration, login, and MFA to your app.
- **Authorization**: Providing users secure access to AWS resources like S3, DynamoDB, and others.
- **Social Login**: Allowing users to sign in using social identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **Multi-device synchronization**: Allowing users to sync their data across multiple devices using Cognito Sync.

### Benefits of AWS Cognito:

- **Scalability**: AWS Cognito can scale to support millions of users.
- **Security**: It supports industry-standard protocols and security features, like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Cost-Effective**: It offers a free tier and flexible pricing that grows with your application.

In summary, AWS Cognito simplifies the process of handling user management, authentication, and secure access control to AWS resources, making it a powerful tool for any modern application.
