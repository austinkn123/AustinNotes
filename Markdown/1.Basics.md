- Polymorphism
- encapsulation
- abstraction
- inheritance



### Side Notes:

Abstraction definition in general in software development:

- Abstraction is a fundamental principle in software development that aims to simplify complex systems or components, making it easier for developers to understand, use, and manage them. By focusing on the essential functionality and hiding intricate details, abstraction promotes modularity, maintainability, and reusability of code.



The provided definitions highlight key concepts related to abstract classes and interfaces in object-oriented programming. Let's break down the definitions:

1. **Abstract Class:**
   - **Definition:** An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, meaning you cannot create objects directly from it. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and can contain a mix of abstract (methods without a body) and non-abstract (methods with an implementation) methods.
   - Key Points:
     - Cannot be instantiated on its own; it needs to be subclassed.
     - Can have abstract methods (without implementation) that must be implemented by its subclasses.
     - Can also have non-abstract methods with a complete implementation.
     - Provides a common base for multiple related classes.
2. **Interface:**
   - **Definition:** An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It specifies the method signatures (name, parameters, and return type) but does not provide the implementation. Classes that implement an interface must provide the actual code for each method declared in the interface.
   - Key Points:
     - Defines a contract or a set of rules that implementing classes must adhere to.
     - Contains method signatures without implementations.
     - Enables multiple inheritance by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
     - Provides a way to achieve abstraction and polymorphism.

**Comparison:**

- **Instantiation:**
  - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated; they are meant to be subclassed.
  - Interfaces cannot be instantiated either; they are implemented by classes.
- **Method Implementation:**
  - Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, with some methods providing a complete implementation.
  - Interfaces only define method signatures without implementations; the implementing classes must provide the actual code.
- **Inheritance:**
  - Abstract classes support single-class inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class).
  - Interfaces support multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
- **Purpose:**
  - Abstract classes are often used to provide a common base with shared functionality among related classes.
  - Interfaces are used to define a contract that multiple unrelated classes can adhere to, promoting code consistency.

In summary, abstract classes and interfaces are tools in object-oriented programming that facilitate code organization, reuse, and consistency by defining a structure for classes to follow. Each has its own use cases and characteristics based on the specific requirements of a software design.

## encapsulation:

- restricting methods and variables to a class

## Static classes

live in memory differently so a new instance is not needed and the method will not change

- Needed for easy access

cant put own code in interface

abstract = signature ( declaration) + body

- doesnt support multiple inheritance
- has constructors
- dont have to use all methods

interface = signature ( declaration )

- supports multiple inheritances
- no constructor
- have to use all methods

NEVER hardcode the access token

Created when configuring Program.cs

## MVC:

- **M**odels: Classes that represent the data of the app. The model classes use validation logic to enforce business rules for that data. Typically, model objects retrieve and store model state in a database.

- **V**iews: Views are the components that display the app's user interface (UI). Generally, this UI displays the model data.

- C

  ontrollers: Classes that:

  - Handle browser requests.
  - Retrieve model data.
  - Call view templates that return a response.

## HTTP endpoint:

- Is a targetable URL in the web application, such as `https://localhost:5001/HelloWorld`.
- Combines:
  - The protocol used: `HTTPS`.
  - The network location of the web server, including the TCP port: `localhost:5001`.
  - The target URI: `HelloWorld`.

## Model Binding:

Definition: maps the named parameters from the query string to parameters in the method

The model binding system:

- Retrieves data from various sources such as route data, form fields, and query strings.
- Provides the data to controllers and Razor pages in method parameters and public properties.
- Converts string data to .NET types.
- Updates properties of complex types.

https://localhost:7169/HelloWorld/Welcome**?**name=Rick**&**numtimes=4

- `?` (question mark) in the above URL is a separator, and the query string follows.
- The `&` character separates field-value pairs.

## IActionResult:

- Defines a contract that represents the result of an action method.

In Program.cs:

app.MapControllerRoute(

name: "default", pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

- the `Movies` controller, the `Details` method, and an `id` value

## Unit testing:

- definition =
- Used to test code quality
  - write code that were independently testable
- tedious
- for controllers:
  - dont test endpoints
- cant unit test db access
- goal = less mocks and test cases
- backend = testing services NOT ENDPOINTS

code:

- solid
  - keep things modular
  - inherited classes can be used and seperated with diff calls

## defensive programming:

- be prepared for errors
- try catch is still good
  - exceptions are good
- testing
  - validation
  - if statements over try/catch

constraints = need both constraints and if statements



## microservices



## SOLID Principles:

- Single-responsibility principle

   = there should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

  - In other words, **a class should have only one primary responsibility**. If a class contains methods that change different models or have multiple distinct purposes, it can become harder to understand, maintain, and modify.

- Openâ€“closed principle

   = software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

  - designing software components (e.g., classes, modules, functions) in a way that allows them to be extended or enhanced to accommodate new functionality without requiring changes to their existing source code

- **Liskov substitution principle** = An inherited class should not try to change the members of its parent class, or the way it behaves. The principle is being violated if one of the child class members throws an exception.

- **Interface segregation principle** = when a class implements an interface where it requires all its members

- Dependency inversion principle

   = high-level classes should not depend on low-level classes

  - High-level modules (e.g., abstractions, interfaces) should not depend on low-level modules (e.g., concrete implementations).
  - Both high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces, abstract classes).
