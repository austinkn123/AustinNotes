# Business Idea:

- Expense tracking: Users can input and categorize their expenses to understand where their money is going.
- Budget creation: The app could assist users in creating budgets based on their income and financial goals.
- Goal setting: Users can set short-term and long-term financial goals, such as saving for a vacation, buying a house, or paying off debt.
- Financial insights: The app could provide personalized insights and recommendations to help users make better financial decisions.
- Reminders and notifications: Users can receive reminders for upcoming bill payments, budget targets, or financial milestones.
- Integration with bank accounts: The app could sync with users' bank accounts to provide real-time updates on transactions and balances.
- Educational resources: The app could offer articles, videos, and tutorials to help users improve their financial literacy and money management skills.

# More Detail:

### 1. **User Authentication and Security**

- **Login/Register:** Users should be able to create accounts and securely log in using credentials.
- **Authentication:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as password hashing

### 2. **Dashboard and Overview**

- **Summary:** Display an overview of the user's financial status, including:
  - account balances, expenses, income, investments bank account info, goals
- **Charts/Graphs:** Use visualizations like charts or graphs to represent spending habits, budget allocations, and trends over time.

### 3. **Transactions and Budgeting**

- **Transaction Management:** Allow users to add, categorize, and track transactions (e.g., income, expenses, transfers).
- **Budgeting Tools:** Enable users to set budgets for different categories (ex: groceries, utilities, entertainment) and track their spending against these budgets.

### 4. **Accounts and Assets**

- **Bank Account Integration:** MAYBE, BIG MAYBE, WISHLIST TYPA THING, integrate with financial institutions to fetch real-time account balances and transactions.
- **Asset Tracking:** Allow users to input and track assets such as properties, investments, and retirement accounts.

### 5. **Goal Setting and Planning**

- **Financial Goals:** Enable users to set financial goals (ex: saving for a vacation, retirement planning) and track progress towards these goals.
- **Savings Planner:** Provide tools to simulate savings scenarios based on different contribution rates and timeframes.

### 6. **Reports and Analytics**

- **Detailed Reports:** Generate detailed reports on spending patterns, income sources, and overall financial health.
- **Financial Insights:** Provide actionable insights based on user data, such as recommendations for improving budgeting or saving habits.

### 7. **Settings and Customization**

- **Profile Management:** Allow users to manage their profiles, update personal information, and configure app settings.
- **Notification Preferences:** Enable users to customize notifications for reminders, alerts, and important financial updates.

### 8. **Additional Features**

- **Expense Tracking:** Capture receipts and categorize expenses.
  - have user take a picture of a receipt and the app will log your expense for you
  - more research on this, barcode scans?
- **Bill Reminders:** Set up reminders for upcoming bills and payments.

### Design Considerations:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure a clean and intuitive design with easy navigation and accessibility features.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Consider developing the app for multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android) to reach a broader audience.
- **Data Security:** Implement security measures to protect user data, including encryption for sensitive information
  - should be big on this one

# Tech Stack:

1. **Frontend Framework**:
   - React.js: You can continue to use React.js for building the frontend of your application.
2. **Backend Framework**:
   - ASP.NET Core: ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications using C#.
3. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL remains the same as the database management system for storing financial data securely.
4. **API Development**:
   - RESTful API: ASP.NET Core supports building RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.
5. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT): You can continue to use JWT for secure authentication and authorization of users.
6. **Integration with Bank Accounts**:
   - Plaid: You can integrate Plaid's APIs into your ASP.NET Core backend to enable integration with users' bank accounts, similar to what you would do with Express.js.
7. **Frontend State Management**:
   - Redux: Redux can still be used for managing the state of your React.js application.
8. **Version Control**:
   - Git: Continue using Git for version control to manage your codebase effectively.
9. **Deployment and Hosting**:
   - AWS, GCP, or Azure: You can choose any of these cloud platforms for hosting and deploying your ASP.NET Core application.
10. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Prometheus and Grafana: You can use these tools for monitoring and logging your ASP.NET Core application's performance and metrics.

# Creating App:

## Database:



## Backend:

Using an N-layer architecture for your backend depends on the complexity and scalability requirements of your application. The N-layer architecture, also known as the multi-layer architecture, is a common architectural pattern that organizes the codebase into logical layers, each with its own responsibilities and concerns. 

1. Choose Asp.net core template

2. Create a app library inside your sln

3. ### Nuget Packages to install

   1. Dapper = micro object relational mapping
   2. npgsql = open source .NET data provider for PostgreSQL

4. ### Dependency Injection

   1. In the Program.cs you need to register all these services into your app
   2. Add singleton services for adding connection strings and other settings
   3. Add transient services for repositories that call to the database
