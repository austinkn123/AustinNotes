# Business Idea:

- Expense tracking: Users can input and categorize their expenses to understand where their money is going.
- Budget creation: The app could assist users in creating budgets based on their income and financial goals.
- Goal setting: Users can set short-term and long-term financial goals, such as saving for a vacation, buying a house, or paying off debt.
- Financial insights: The app could provide personalized insights and recommendations to help users make better financial decisions.
- Reminders and notifications: Users can receive reminders for upcoming bill payments, budget targets, or financial milestones.
- Integration with bank accounts: The app could sync with users' bank accounts to provide real-time updates on transactions and balances.
- Educational resources: The app could offer articles, videos, and tutorials to help users improve their financial literacy and money management skills.

# Tech Stack:

1. **Frontend Framework**:
   - React.js: You can continue to use React.js for building the frontend of your application.
2. **Backend Framework**:
   - ASP.NET Core: ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications using C#.
3. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL remains the same as the database management system for storing financial data securely.
4. **API Development**:
   - RESTful API: ASP.NET Core supports building RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.
5. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT): You can continue to use JWT for secure authentication and authorization of users.
7. **Frontend State Management**:
   - React Hooks or state hooks.
8. **Version Control**:
   - Git: Continue using Git for version control to manage your codebase effectively.
9. **Deployment and Hosting**:
   - AWS, GCP, or Azure: You can choose any of these cloud platforms for hosting and deploying your ASP.NET Core application.

# Creating App:

## Database:



## Backend:

Using an N-layer architecture for your backend depends on the complexity and scalability requirements of your application. The N-layer architecture, also known as the multi-layer architecture, is a common architectural pattern that organizes the codebase into logical layers, each with its own responsibilities and concerns. 

1. Choose Asp.net core template

2. Create a app library inside your sln

3. ### Nuget Packages to install

   1. Dapper = micro object relational mapping
   2. npgsql = open source .NET data provider for PostgreSQL

4. ### Dependency Injection

   1. In the Program.cs you need to register all these services into your app
   2. Add singleton services for adding connection strings and other settings
   3. Add transient services for repositories that call to the database
