# Business Idea:

- Expense tracking: Users can input and categorize their expenses to understand where their money is going.
- Budget creation: The app could assist users in creating budgets based on their income and financial goals.
- Goal setting: Users can set short-term and long-term financial goals, such as saving for a vacation, buying a house, or paying off debt.
- Financial insights: The app could provide personalized insights and recommendations to help users make better financial decisions.
- Reminders and notifications: Users can receive reminders for upcoming bill payments, budget targets, or financial milestones.
- Integration with bank accounts: The app could sync with users' bank accounts to provide real-time updates on transactions and balances.
- Educational resources: The app could offer articles, videos, and tutorials to help users improve their financial literacy and money management skills.

# More Detail:

### 1. **User Authentication and Security**

- **Login/Register:** Users should be able to create accounts and securely log in using credentials.
- **Authentication:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as password hashing

### 2. **Dashboard and Overview**

- **Summary:** Display an overview of the user's financial status, including:
  - account balances, expenses, income, investments bank account info, goals
- **Charts/Graphs:** Use visualizations like charts or graphs to represent spending habits, budget allocations, and trends over time.

### 3. **Transactions and Budgeting**

- **Transaction Management:** Allow users to add, categorize, and track transactions (e.g., income, expenses, transfers).
- **Budgeting Tools:** Enable users to set budgets for different categories (ex: groceries, utilities, entertainment) and track their spending against these budgets.

### 4. **Accounts and Assets**

- **Bank Account Integration:** MAYBE, BIG MAYBE, WISHLIST TYPA THING, integrate with financial institutions to fetch real-time account balances and transactions.
- **Asset Tracking:** Allow users to input and track assets such as properties, investments, and retirement accounts.

### 5. **Goal Setting and Planning**

- **Financial Goals:** Enable users to set financial goals (ex: saving for a vacation, retirement planning) and track progress towards these goals.
- **Savings Planner:** Provide tools to simulate savings scenarios based on different contribution rates and timeframes.

### 6. **Reports and Analytics**

- **Detailed Reports:** Generate detailed reports on spending patterns, income sources, and overall financial health.
- **Financial Insights:** Provide actionable insights based on user data, such as recommendations for improving budgeting or saving habits.

### 7. **Settings and Customization**

- **Profile Management:** Allow users to manage their profiles, update personal information, and configure app settings.
- **Notification Preferences:** Enable users to customize notifications for reminders, alerts, and important financial updates.

### 8. **Additional Features**

- **Expense Tracking:** Capture receipts and categorize expenses.
  - have user take a picture of a receipt and the app will log your expense for you
  - more research on this, barcode scans?
- **Bill Reminders:** Set up reminders for upcoming bills and payments.

### Design Considerations:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure a clean and intuitive design with easy navigation and accessibility features.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Consider developing the app for multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android) to reach a broader audience.
- **Data Security:** Implement security measures to protect user data, including encryption for sensitive information
  - should be big on this one

# Tech Stack:

1. **Frontend Framework**:
   - React.js: You can continue to use React.js for building the frontend of your application.
2. **Backend Framework**:
   - ASP.NET Core: ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications using C#.
3. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL remains the same as the database management system for storing financial data securely.
4. **API Development**:
   - RESTful API: ASP.NET Core supports building RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.
5. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT): You can continue to use JWT for secure authentication and authorization of users.
7. **Frontend State Management**:
   - React Hooks or state hooks.
8. **Version Control**:
   - Git: Continue using Git for version control to manage your codebase effectively.
9. **Deployment and Hosting**:
   - AWS, GCP, or Azure: You can choose any of these cloud platforms for hosting and deploying your ASP.NET Core application.

# Creating App:

## Database:



## Backend:

Using an N-layer architecture for your backend depends on the complexity and scalability requirements of your application. The N-layer architecture, also known as the multi-layer architecture, is a common architectural pattern that organizes the codebase into logical layers, each with its own responsibilities and concerns. 

1. Choose Asp.net core template

2. Create a app library inside your sln

3. ### Nuget Packages to install

   1. Dapper = micro object relational mapping
   2. npgsql = open source .NET data provider for PostgreSQL

4. ### Dependency Injection

   1. In the Program.cs you need to register all these services into your app
   2. Add singleton services for adding connection strings and other settings
   3. Add transient services for repositories that call to the database

# Personal Progress / Notes Journal:

- Starting this to keep track of everything I need to do and everything I've learned.
- Started setting up the app to use repositories with the 3 tier architecture'
  - I have done this in the past but I don't like how I need a interface for every class that is reaching out to the database
- Decided to redesign my app to follow **clean architecture**
  - learned about how dotnet uses assemblies and reflection so I can set up the dependency injection cleanly
    - More specifically I can pass in custom attributes and the DI will read that and assign services depending on that attribute
- Started work on my frontend using **material ui**
  - slight learning curve, as I am using material ui's component library instead of creating my own so its harder to customize
  - (MVP) Minimal Viable Product means that my app's useablilty will do up but the creativity will go down. I am ok with this solution right now
- Learned I need to set up the login and sign up for my app. Decided to go with **AWS Cognito** Set up my user pool and app client. This is a lot more involved than I originally thought 
  - Struggled a bit when creating a google sign up option in aws because of the attributes that google api provides versus the ones I was sending in from aws. Apparently birthday and phone number is not valid for google. I am probably doing something wrong
  - Decided to leave out bday and phone num and signing in works from the aws site
- Needed to integrate aws cognito into my app
  - starting with the server side
  - Had slight trouble going through the sign up process as I kept running into an error saying name_formatted is required
  - figured out I need a new attribute type for my userattributes dictionary. So sign up works now
- Struggling with the login, I am getting a {"The security token included in the request is invalid."} error. 
  - I have double checked my client id, client secret ,secret hash method and auth flows. All looks good. 
  - I figured it had something to do with my token needing to be refreshed. That is not the case because how would I get the token if I am not even signed in yet
  - Saw on google that I might need to set up a aws access key and secret key
    - to do that I need to set up a IAM user on aws. This is a another service on aws that helps keep track of permissions on who is calling their methods? I also had to set up the groups and roles for IAM
    - it goes app --> cognito --> iam user --> aws resources
    - Now downloading the aws toolkit for visual studio and I added the aws access key and secret key to be able to use the aws explorer window
      - next plan of attack: use those creds that I put in for aws toolkit into my code and hopefully I will not get that error anymore when logging in
  - After I set that up I need to set up the logout and google's sign up, sign in, and log out. Then I need to set up the adapters to take in aws instances so everything isn't in the controller and my code will follow clean architecture more closely
