### 1. **What is a Proxy?**

A **proxy** acts as an intermediary between two systems—in this case, between your Vite development server and your ASP.NET Core backend server. It forwards requests from one server to another, often transforming or adding information to requests as needed.

In your setup:

- **Frontend (Vite Dev Server)**:

  - Runs on `localhost:5173`.
  - Handles the development of the React app, serving static assets and enabling hot module reloading (HMR).
  - This is **not** a full backend server; it's just for serving static frontend files during development.

  **Backend (ASP.NET Core API)**:

  - Runs on another port like `localhost:7121`.
  - Handles API requests, business logic, database interaction, etc.
  - This is your actual backend server, which processes requests and returns data (such as from `/api/users`).

When your React app makes requests to `/api/*`, the Vite proxy forwards those requests to the ASP.NET Core API at `https://localhost:7121/api/*`. This is helpful for local development because you can interact with both the frontend and backend as if they were on the same server (which avoids issues like cross-origin resource sharing, or CORS).

### 2. **Why Can't the Proxy Use the Same Port?**

Each server or service needs to listen on a unique port number. If both the Vite server and the ASP.NET Core server tried to use the same port (e.g., both on `localhost:5173`), there would be a conflict because a port can only be occupied by one process at a time.

Here’s why:

- **Ports identify specific processes**: Ports are like numbered doors into a computer. When you run a server (like Vite or ASP.NET Core), it "listens" for traffic on a specific port. If two servers try to use the same port, they would conflict because the operating system wouldn't know which server the traffic is meant for.
- **Separation of concerns**: Vite and ASP.NET Core have different purposes. Vite serves the React app (frontend), while ASP.NET Core serves API data (backend). They need to operate on different ports to handle requests correctly.

For example:

- Vite: `localhost:5173` serves the React app.
- ASP.NET Core: `localhost:7121` serves the API.

### 3. **How the Proxy Works in Your Case**

Without the proxy, you would have to manually direct requests to the correct server:

- For React: `localhost:5173`
- For ASP.NET Core API: `localhost:7121`

However, a proxy lets you **avoid hardcoding the API's port** in your React app. Instead, you can write your API requests relative to the frontend, like this:

```
js


Copy code
axios.get('/api/users');
```

Then, Vite intercepts these requests to `/api/*`, recognizes that they should go to the ASP.NET Core backend (via the proxy configuration in `vite.config.js`), and forwards them to `https://localhost:7121/api/*`.

This setup allows your React app to treat everything like it's on the same server (avoiding CORS issues), but Vite forwards the requests behind the scenes.

### Example Scenario:

1. Your React app at `https://localhost:5173` makes an API request to `/api/users`.
2. The Vite development server sees that requests to `/api` should be forwarded to `https://localhost:7121`.
3. Vite forwards the request from `https://localhost:5173/api/users` to `https://localhost:7121/api/users`.
4. The ASP.NET Core API processes the request and sends the response back through the proxy to Vite, which then returns the response to your React app.

### Summary

- **The proxy** allows your frontend (running on port 5173) to make requests to your backend (running on port 7121) as if they were on the same server.
- **Ports must be different** for each service to avoid conflicts, as only one process can listen on a specific port.
