# C#

1. **Syntax:**

   - C# syntax is similar to other C-style languages like C++ and Java. It uses curly braces **`{}`** to define code blocks and semicolons **`;`** to end statements.

2. **Data Types:**

   - C# supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, booleans, and more.

3. **Variables and Constants:**

   - Variables store data values, while constants hold values that cannot be changed.
   - Example: **`int age = 25; const double pi = 3.14159;`**

4. **Control Flow:**

   - C# provides control flow constructs like **`if`**, **`else`**, **`switch`**, **`while`**, **`for`**, and **`foreach`** to manage program execution.

5. **Functions (Methods):**

   - Functions in C# are called methods. They can be defined with parameters, return types, and can have access modifiers.

   - Example:

     ```
     csharpCopy code
     int Add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b;
     }
     ```

6. **Classes and Objects:**

   - C# is an object-oriented language. Classes define blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of classes.

   - Example:

     ```
     csharpCopy code
     class Person {
         public string Name { get; set; }
         public int Age { get; set; }
     }
     ```

7. **Inheritance and Polymorphism:**

   - C# supports inheritance, where a class can inherit properties and methods from another class. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent classes.

8. **Interfaces:**

   - Interfaces define contracts that classes must follow. A class implementing an interface must provide implementations for the interface's methods.

9. **Exception Handling:**

   - C# provides **`try`**, **`catch`**, and **`finally`** blocks for handling exceptions and ensuring proper resource cleanup.

10. **Namespaces:**

    - Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups. They prevent naming conflicts and aid in maintaining large projects.

11. **Properties and Indexers:**

    - Properties provide controlled access to class fields. Indexers allow objects to be indexed like arrays.

12. **Delegates and Events:**

    - Delegates are function pointers that allow methods to be passed as parameters. Events provide a way for classes to communicate with each other.

13. **Lambda Expressions:**

    - Lambda expressions provide a concise way to define anonymous methods and can be used in LINQ queries.

14. **LINQ (Language Integrated Query):**

    - LINQ is used to query collections, databases, and other data sources using a consistent syntax.

15. **Asynchronous Programming:**

    - C# supports asynchronous programming using the **`async`** and **`await`** keywords, allowing non-blocking execution.

16. **Attributes:**

    - Attributes provide metadata and instructions to the compiler or runtime. They can be used to annotate classes, methods, and more.

17. **Nullable Types:**

    - C# allows value types to be nullable using the **`Nullable<T>`** structure. It's useful for cases where a variable might not have a value.



## ASSEMBLY:

An assembly is a compiled code library in .NET that can be used for deployment, versioning, and security.

- It contains code in the form of Intermediate Language (IL) and metadata about the code, such as types and their relationships.
- Assemblies are fundamental units of deployment and versioning in .NET
  - An assembly is typically a .dll (Dynamic Link Library) or .exe (Executable) file.
  - It can contain one or more namespaces, classes, interfaces, and other types.

## REFLECTION:

reflection is a feature in .NET that allows code to inspect and interact with object types and members (such as properties, methods, and fields) at runtime
